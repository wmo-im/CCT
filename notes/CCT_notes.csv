1,"All GPS radiosondes are with thermistor, silicon piezoresistive pressure sensor or pressure derived from GPS height, capacitive relative humidity sensor and wind derived from GPS height.",C02
2,All unassigned numbers are reserved for future use.,"C03, C04"
3,CREX master table version numbers 8-15 are not used.,C00
4,"Dobson Unit = DU. One Dobson Unit corresponds to a layer of 0.01 mm of pure ozone, if the whole column of atmosphere were compressed at P = 1013 hPa and T = 0 °C.",C06
5,"For the definitions of sub-centres provided to the WMO Secretariat, see Common Code table C-12.","C01, C11"
6,"In the case of BUFR and CREX, these version numbers apply to the master table 0.",C00
7,Introduction of Common Code table C-0 is a legal initiative. WMO Members and other TDCF users could practically deal with the version numbers the same as before until their software becomes capable of referring to the common code table.,C00
8,Non-WMO abbreviations with limited character sets taken from ISO 2955-1983. Other abbreviations try to be consistent with this.,C06
9,"Prefixes beyond exa and atto have been proposed but not yet adopted. Use of the prefixes hecto, deca, deci and centi is discouraged",C06
10,"Prefixes generally should not be used with units having non-decimal multiples and sub-multiples, such as units of time and angle, or with knots and nautical miles.",C06
11,References to countries in brackets indicate the manufacturing location rather than the country using the instrument.,C02
12,Some of the radiosondes listed are no longer in use but are retained for archiving purposes.,C02
13,"The abbreviation for degrees Celsius proposed for WMO use, C, could be confused with Coulombs. In this case, Amperes second should be used instead.",C06
14,"The alphanumeric code format reports only 2 digits, and the first digit for BUFR is identified from the date: the first digit is 0 if the introduction of the radiosonde for observation was before 30 June 2007, or 1 otherwise. Entries in the second part of the table (after 99), which are declared ""Vacant"" can be used for new radiosondes because the 2-digit number was originally attributed to sondes, which are no longer used. This system has been adopted to accommodate reporting in TEMP traditional alphanumeric code format up to the time BUFR is fully used for radiosonding reports.",C02
15,"The closed bracket sign "")"" indicates that the corresponding code figure is reserved for the previously named centre.",C11
16,The closed bracket sign ) indicates that the corresponding code figure is reserved for the previously named centre.,C01
17,"The decibel is one tenth of a bel, which is the decimal logarithm of a ratio of two powers. Frequently, suffixes are supplied to indicate information about one of the quantities in the ratio, such as dB(mW), dBm, dBZ, dBW, dBmW, dB(μV/m). It is recommended that only dB is used, with the full meaning of the ratio explained, including reference levels.",C06
18,The depth is calculated from coefficients a and b and the time t as follows: z = at + 10-3 bt 2,C03
19,"The international system of units, Système International d'Unités (SI), was established by the eleventh General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960, and extended at the 1980 Conference. There are seven base units, two dimensionless supplementary units and a set of prefixes for decimal scaling. These may be combined to give compound units. Some compound units have special names, and are called derived Units.",C06
20,The values of a and b are supplied for information only.,C03
21,This list consists of the units not mentioned previously that occur in existing WMO Manuals.,C06
22,"When documenting compound SI units, each symbol for each base unit has been separated from the others by a space. There is no space between the unit and any prefix or exponent. Any prefix establishes a new unit to which any exponent applies (e.g.km2 = (km)2 = m6 not k(m2) = m5). Prefixes must be in the case specified. The full name of the unit must not start with an upper case letter. If the solidus (/) is used, there must be only one. There is no space before or after it.",C06
23,"With GRIB or BUFR, to indicate whether the originating/generating centre is a sub-centre or not, the following procedure should be applied:In GRIB edition 1, use octet 26 of section 1, or in BUFR edition 3, use octet 5 of section 1, with the following meaning: Code figure0 Not a sub-centre, the originating/generating centre is the centre defined by Octet 5 in section 1 of GRIB Edition 1, or by octet 6 in section 1 of BUFR edition 3.1 to 254 Identifier of the sub-centre which is the originating/generating centre. The identifier of the subcentre is allocated by the associated centre which is defined by octet 5 in section 1 of GRIB edition1, or octet 6 in section 1 of BUFR edition 3. The sub-centre identifiers should be supplied to the WMO Secretariat by the associated centre(s) for publication.",C01
24,"With GRIB or BUFR, to indicate whether the originating/generating centre is a sub-centre or not, the following procedure should be applied:In GRIB edition 2, use octets 8-9 of section 1, or in BUFR edition 4, use octets 7-8 of section 1, with the following meaning: Code figure0 Not a sub-centre, the originating/generating centre is the centre defined by octets 6-7 in section 1of GRIB edition 2, or by octets 5-6 in section 1 of BUFR edition 4.1 to 254 Identifier of the sub-centre which is the originating/generating centre. The identifier of the sub-centre is allocated by the associated centre, which is defined by octets 6-7 in section 1 of GRIB edition 2 or by octets 5-6 in section 1 of BUFR edition 4. The sub-centre identifiers should be supplied to the WMO Secretariat by the associated centre(s) for publication.",C11
25,"Within the ranges 000 to 849 and 870 to 998, even deciles indicate polar orbiting satellites and odd deciles indicate geostationary satellites. The range from 850 to 869 shall be used to indicate combinations of satellites, so the aforementioned decile rule does not apply to values in this range.",C05
